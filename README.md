Demo simulations using the ndnSIM

ndnSIM is a network simulator built using the well known ns-3 simulator.

In the example here, a p2p_node has been developed which takes the interest packet from a consumer and returns the appropriate response.

The framework is suitable for the p2p blockchain simulations
